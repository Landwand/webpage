	<p>Inspired by some YouTube video 'along with work from home' due to COVID-19, I thought to do something productive with my time and try my hand at it.-</p>

	<p>The concept is simple: mix flour and water and let it sit in a jar to rot and ferment over a few days.  When the culture is built up, a "starter", this can be used to knead into dough to bake bread.</p>

	<p>The instructions are simple, but like with all art, there are veriables in technique that will take a lifetime to master.</p>

	<p>Somewhere in late March, 2020, I make my first batch of dough.  It rises well and looks encouraging.  I hope that it blooms and blossoms the oven to an angelic bread.  But I have baked before, and I know that it's usually a loaf of disappointment.</p>
